   ```

2. Clone this repository:

   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/rethink-studios/comfyui-model-linker.git
   ```

3. Restart ComfyUI

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Open Model Linker**: Click the "🔗 Model Linker" button in the UI
2. **Review Missing Models**: The dialog shows all missing models organized by confidence level:

   **🟢 100% Perfect Matches** (Green)
   - Exact filename matches after normalization
   - Will be auto-resolved when you click "Auto-Resolve 100% Matches"
   
   **🟡 90-99% High Confidence** (Orange)
   - Shows 2-3 best matching options
   - Each option has its own "Resolve" button
   - Click "Resolve" on the correct model
   - Great for minor filename variations (e.g., `model_v1` vs `model-v1`)
   
   **⚪ 70-89% Medium Confidence** (Gray)
   - Shows 2-3 possible matches with radio buttons
   - Select the correct model using radio buttons
   - Click "Resolve Selected" to apply your choice
   - Manual verification recommended
   
   **❌ < 70% No Good Match** (Red) 🆕
   - Shows search buttons for CivitAI and HuggingFace
   - Paste a download URL in the input field
   - Click "Download" to start downloading
   - Watch real-time progress bar with cancel option
   - Model auto-installs when complete

3. **Resolve Your Choices**: 
   - For 90-99%: Click "Resolve" on the correct option
   - For 70-89%: Select with radio button, then click "Resolve Selected"
   - For < 70%: Search, paste URL, and download
   
4. **Auto-Resolve Perfect Matches**: Click "Auto-Resolve 100% Matches" to fix all perfect matches at once

### Download Workflow (For Missing Models)

1. **Find the Model**: Click "Search CivitAI" or "Search HuggingFace" to open search in new tab
2. **Get Download URL**: Copy the direct download link from the model page
3. **Paste URL**: Paste the URL in the input field
4. **Start Download**: Click the "Download" button
5. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the progress bar (percentage and MB)
6. **Cancel Anytime**: Click "Cancel" button to stop download if needed
7. **Auto-Install**: Model automatically places in correct directory when complete
8. **Verify**: Model Linker refreshes and shows the model as resolved

**Safety Note:** Downloads use temporary `.tmp` files during transfer, so cancelled or failed downloads never corrupt your model library!

### Dragging the Button

- Click and hold the button to drag it to your preferred position
- Position is automatically saved and persists across sessions
- Quick click (without dragging) opens the Model Linker dialog

## How It Works

### Detection

The Model Linker scans your workflow and identifies:
- Checkpoints
- LoRAs
- VAEs
- ControlNet models
- Text encoders
- And more...

### Fuzzy Matching

Uses **token-based intelligent matching** to find similar models:
- **Exact filename matches** (100% confidence)
- **Version number awareness**: Distinguishes `2.1` from `2.2`, `v1` from `v2`
- **Token-based comparison**: Breaks filenames into meaningful components
- **Weighted scoring**: 70% token similarity + 30% character similarity
- **Normalized comparisons**: Handles `_`, `-`, `.` variations (e.g., `model_name` = `model-name`)
- **Category-aware searching**: Only searches appropriate model types

**Example:**
```
Target: wan2.1_t2v_14B_fp8_scaled.safetensors

❌ Wrong:   wan2.2_fun_control_high_noise... → 49% (different version!)
✅ Correct: Wan2_1-T2V-14B_fp8_e4m3fn...    → 87% (same version & key tokens)
```

### Resolution

When you resolve a model:
1. The workflow is updated with the correct model path
2. The UI immediately reflects the change
3. The updated workflow is ready to run

## Configuration

### Model Paths

Model Linker automatically scans all configured model directories in ComfyUI. To add additional directories:

1. Edit your `extra_model_paths.yaml` file
2. Add your custom model directories
3. Restart ComfyUI

Example:
```yaml
your_models:
  base_path: C:\ComfyUI\models
  checkpoints: checkpoints
  loras: loras
  vae: vae
```

## Troubleshooting

### Button Not Showing

1. Check the browser console (Ctrl+Shift+I) for errors
2. Ensure the extension loaded: Look for "Model Linker: API routes registered successfully!"
3. Try clearing browser cache and restarting ComfyUI

### Models Not Found

1. Verify your model directories are configured in `extra_model_paths.yaml`
2. Check that models are in the correct category folders
3. Ensure ComfyUI can access the directories (permissions)

### Resolution Not Working

1. Open the browser console (Ctrl+Shift+I) to see detailed logs
2. Check for "Updated X model paths in workflow" message
3. Verify the workflow format is compatible (Graph or API format)

### Download Issues 🆕

**Download Won't Start:**
1. Verify the URL is a direct download link (not a webpage)
2. Check browser console (Ctrl+Shift+I) for errors
3. Ensure you have write permissions to model directories

**Cancelled Download Still Shows as Missing:**
✅ This is correct! Cancelled downloads are cleaned up (`.tmp` files deleted) to prevent corrupted models.

**Download Stuck/Slow:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try cancelling and restarting the download
3. Some hosts may rate-limit downloads

**Model Not Appearing After Download:**
1. Wait for "Download complete" alert
2. Check the browser console for the installation path
3. Verify the model was placed in the correct category folder
4. Try clicking "Reload" in Model Linker dialog
